### The project is completely responsive, so you can get cute random dogs anywhere you are, with your phone, tablet, notebook or desktop!

<br>

This project was made for learning purposes completely by myself, without any tutorial, so there’s surely a lot of things i could’ve made better, but guess? It works anyway! :)

<br>

Made using React and accessing the [Dog Ceo](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) Api with axios!
